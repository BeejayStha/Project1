# Project 1: Process Scheduler


## Description 
For this project we'll be building a simple process scheduler that takes in a file containing example processes, and outputs a schedule based on the three different schedule types:

- First-Come First-Serve (FC-FS)
- Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
- SJF-Priority
- Round-robin (RR)
- Assume that all processes are CPU bound (they do not block for I/O).
